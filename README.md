# Deliveroo Clone React Native

This is a Deliveroo clone built using React Native and Expo. It is a mobile application that allows users to order food from restaurants and have it delivered to their location.

## Features

-   Browse restaurants and their menus
-   Add items to cart and place orders
-   Real-time order tracking
-   Integration with Google Maps API for location and directions

## Setup

To run the app locally, you'll need to have Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install it globally using npm:

Copy code

    npm install -g expo-cli

Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

Copy code

    git clone https://github.com/srimalonline/deliveroo-clone-react-native.git
    cd deliveroo-clone-react-native
    npm install

Finally, start the Expo development server:

Copy code

    expo start

This will open a Metro Bundler in your default web browser. From here, you can either run the app in an iOS or Android emulator, or on a physical device using the Expo client app.
